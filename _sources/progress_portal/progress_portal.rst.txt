Progress Protal System
============================

Motivation
----------
I use a lot of things on a daily basis, from todolist to calendars and many more. Given the numerous tools I use, I often forget to check all and tracking my progress is difficult. Keep all of this in mind, I want to build something that brings everything home, to my secondBrain.
