Knowledge Test System
============================

Motivation
----------
I look at a lot of things and constantly consume information but I hardly remember most of it. I want to build a system capable of helping me retain more of what I learn.

Intended Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This app should have mutiple feautures:
    1. It should have a place where I can add new knowledge items: links to videos, pdfs, website links, and more.
    2. For each of those knowledge items, it should be able to parse information.
        For example: For a video, it should transcribe it.
    3. Then it should be able to create summaries for easy ingestion.
    4. Then it should create reminders for reviews and test taking.
    5. It should also adjust my learning, frequency of tests and revisions, based on how I do on tests.

This app may branch out into several different apps.
